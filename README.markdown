# SynthNet

Welcome to the most synthetic of nets

---

install packages with `npm install`

Run it with `node app.js`

To compile the client scripts, run `gulp` in the command prompt. This will watch for changes and compile the scripts (it takes a little while to compile, srys). [source/client_scripts.js](source/client_scripts.js) contains the code for the clients and the code for making noise. 

You'll see more instructions when you run it.
